When labeling your clusters, you want to avoid the scenario where all clusters are labeled as \"pizza\" simply because of the uniformly large number of these restaurants across all clusters. In other words, we donâ€™t want to point out that pizza restaurants are pretty much evenly distributed in high quantities everywhere, but rather discover when they, or another type of restaurant, appear in notably high quantities."
